 ### Repeatable

 `Repeatable` is a very simple protocol, which your `NSOperation` subclasses
 can conform to. This allows the previous operation to define whether a new
 one should be executed. For this special case, `RepeatedOperation` can be
 initialized like this:

 ```swift
 let operation = RepeatedOperation { MyRepeatableOperation() }
 ```

 - see: RepeatedOperation

     Implement this funtion to return true if a new
     instance should be added to a RepeatedOperation.

     - parameter count: the number of instances already executed within
     the RepeatedOperation.
     - returns: a Bool, false will end the RepeatedOperation.
